Perfect numbers are natural numbers whose positive divisors are equal to themselves.
Perfect numbers are natural numbers whose positive divisors are equal to themselves. That is, the positive divisors of a number, except the number itself, are equal to that number when added together.

For example, 28 is a perfect number because it equals 1 + 2 + 4 + 7 + 14 = 28. As another example, 6 is also a perfect number because it equals 1 + 2 + 3 = 6.

Perfect numbers have fascinated mathematicians throughout history and have a special mathematical significance. Ancient Greek mathematician Euclid, BC. He studied some properties of perfect numbers in the 4th century and found some. In particular, he found a set of perfect numbers, which he showed could be expressed in the form 2^n-1 * (2^n - 1). Such perfect numbers are called "Mersenne perfect numbers" and are still of interest as a subject of mathematical research.

But perfect numbers are extremely rare. The largest perfect numbers ever found have been obtained using computers. Perfect numbers still retain their importance as a subject of mathematical research, and work in this area continues.
